=====================
FaaSpot Python Client
=====================

Overview
--------

What is FaaSpot?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FaaSpot is a SAAS service that enables you to run functions as a service (FAAS), and reduce your monthly Cloud expenses.

How can we help you make significant cost savings?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need us if you are using an expensive, powerful machine in AWS to run a small set of tasks multiple times.

With FaaSpot you can replace the expensive machine with a much smaller one, and use spot instances to run functions.
The cost of running four spot instances with a single CPU in much less then running one Amazon machine with four CPUs.
With us you'll get the same performance, for less, much less, money.

How can I use it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can access FaaSpot using the FaaSpot client from the CLI, directly from the Python script (as a library),
or by using the proprietary REST API.
The FaaSpot’s command-line interface is the default method for interacting with FaaSpot and managing your functions.

Version compatibility: Python 2.7, 3.3-3.5

.. note::
   The communication with the ``FaaSpot`` webserver is encrypted and secured.

If you haven’t already obtained a FaaSpot API key, send us a request to info@faaspot.com.
